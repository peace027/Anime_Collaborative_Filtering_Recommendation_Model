# Anime_Collaborative_Filtering_Recommendation_Model

The Anime_Data can be directly download from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/peacelife/anime-data-2023

Collaborative Recommender Model has been built to predict the rating a user would give a anime and recommend more animes on that basis.

The complete analysis and visualization has been uploaded at this git.

Images and other Stat scrapper code has also been shared. Use it for several other applications like for manga and movies.
